One major step in this process was **detection**, or the acknowledgement that an target echo has been received.

    "In this lab, we learned the intuitive connection between the ability to confidently detect the presence of a target echo and its *signal-to-noise ratio* (SNR). Then, we derived the form of the signal-to-noise ratio for a radar system using two applications of the *Friis transmission equation*. This creates three useful forms of the *radar range equation*: *received power*, *received energy*, and *signal-to-noise ratio*. These quantities were then investigated for a dish radar system with adjustable parameters. Finally, we introduced the convenient notion of a *reference SNR* that can be used to summarize a radar's performance and allow for quick calculation for other targets and ranges."
