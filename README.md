Introduction to Radar Course
----------------------------

Installation
============

Welcome to the course material for the Introduction to Radar class. The main lectures come in the form of Jupyter notebooks with interactive elements. The official method of installation is using `pip`; however, there is an alternate method for users preferring Anaconda.

## Using `pip`

### JupyterLab Installation

If you have not, first install Python on your system; you can download the Python installer from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

Next, we will have to make a virtual environment to run JupyterLab and the radar course. Create a folder of your choice, and it will now be referred to as `<venv-dir>`. After creating the directory, open a command prompt and run:

    cd <venv-dir>
    python -m venv .

This will create a Python virtual environment in this directory. Next, we will activate the virtual environment. Staying in the `<venv-dir>` directory, run:

    .\Scripts\activate

The command prompt should now show that you are in your virtual environment. Next, we will install the necessary prerequisite packages.

    pip install jupyterlab numpy scipy matplotlib ipympl jupyterlab-mathjax3
    
### Radar Course

Starting with a new terminal/command prompt:

    cd <venv-dir>
    .\Scripts\activate

Navigate to the path of the radar course material:

    cd <radar-course-path>

Lastly, we can start JupyterLab in the current location:

    jupyter lab
