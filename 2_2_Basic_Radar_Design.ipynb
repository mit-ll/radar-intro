    "From [Lab 2.1: Radar Range Equation](2_1_Range_Range_Equation.ipynb), we saw that if we know certain aspects of the radar system (e.g., transmit energy, transmit gain, etc.), it is possible to derive the received energy from a target echo. If we also know the characteristics of the noise in the radar system, we can also calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR is a key quantity that allows us to deduce whether we should be able to detect a target echo in a given situation. If the SNR is high ($\\gg 0~\\mathrm{dB}$), the echo should be confidently detected; if the SNR is low ($\\leq 0~\\mathrm{dB}$), it will be difficult to discern the echo from the noise. (We will discuss this in more detail in [Lab 3.2: Detection](3_2_Detection.ipynb).)"
